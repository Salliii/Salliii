Hello, my name is Silas, also known as Sali. I am currently in an apprenticeship as an electronics technician in the field of devices and systems. 

I have been very interested in programming for several years and have familiarized myself with a number of programming languages and many different subject areas. The topics I am most interested in include linux and everything that goes with it, the development of applications and their graphical user interfaces, and the security of networks, websites, and programs.
