Hello, my name is Silas, also known as Sali. I am currently in an apprenticeship as an electronics technician in the field of devices and systems. 

I have been very interested in programming for several years and have familiarized myself with a number of programming languages and many different subject areas. The topics that interest me the most are Linux and everything related to it, website development and the security of networks, websites and programs.
